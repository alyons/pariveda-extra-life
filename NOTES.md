# Website Notes

- Mobile design will be really helpful!
  - Does js run on phones?
  - Can we turn off the auto-refresh if mobile? Would it be better to have a toggle at the top for auto refresh?
  - Do we use something like Bootstrap V4?
- Better url for the website (maybe a proper domain/sub-domain/endpoint)
